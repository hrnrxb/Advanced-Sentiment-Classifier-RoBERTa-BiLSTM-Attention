# 🧠 Advanced Sentiment Classifier: RoBERTa + BiLSTM + Attention

Dive into the nuances of language with this **powerful sentiment analysis model** that goes beyond simple positive/negative detection. Built with the robust `roberta-base` transformer, enhanced by a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) for sequential understanding, and refined with an attention mechanism, this model can truly **handle sarcasm, irony, and even mixed opinions** in text.

## ✅ Features: What Makes This Model Stand Out?

This isn't your average sentiment analyzer. It's engineered to understand the subtleties of human expression:

* **Master of Nuance:**
    * Handles complex sentences with remarkable accuracy, such as:
        * “If I had a dollar for every cliché in this film, I’d be rich.” ➜ 🔴 **Negative** (Recognizes sarcasm)
        * “It’s fine. Just fine. Totally... fine.” ➜ 🔴 **Negative** (Detects understated negativity/irony)
* **Robust Training:** Initially trained on the **IMDB (20K samples)** dataset, making it highly effective for movie reviews and similar textual data. It's also **extensible to other challenging datasets** like SST-5 (fine-grained sentiment) or dedicated Sarcasm datasets.
* **Multilingual Ready:** Designed for flexibility! Easily switch to `xlm-roberta` to **add support for multiple languages, including Persian**, opening up new possibilities for diverse text analysis.
* **Instant Interaction:** Comes with a **ready-to-use Gradio interface**, allowing anyone to test the model with their own text in real-time.
* **Hassle-Free Deployment:** Fully **deployable on Hugging Face Spaces**, providing a free and easy way to share your model with the world.
